# Graph Depth First

## Problem Domain

In this code challenge, we are tasked with making a method of the graph class. Its parameter is a node and it should return a collection of nodes in the pre-ordered traversal order.

## Algorithm

The algorithm is basically the same as a tree depth first. You need to make sure to add to the visited nodes to make sure that the node isn't revisited.

## Efficiency

The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is also O(n).
