# Graphs

## Problem Domain

In this code challenge we are tasked with making a graphs class. In this graphs class we are supposed to be able to add nodes and edges, to get neighbors and nodes, and make a method that returns the size of the graph. This was whiteboarded out with the whole class in a DSA lecture.

## Efficiency

### Add Node

- Time complexity: O(1)

### Add Edge

- Time complexity: O(1)

### Get Nodes

- Time complexity: O(n)

### Get Neighbors

- Time complexity: O(n)

## Size

- Time complexity: O(n)

### Breadth First Traversal

- Time complexity: O(n)
