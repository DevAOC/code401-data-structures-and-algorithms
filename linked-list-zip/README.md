# Linked List Zip

In this code challenge we are tasked with making a method for a linked list. This method should take in two linked lists and merge them together. It should take the first linked list's head as the head and alternate each node from both lists into one. You may not use built in methods but you can use methods made previously in your linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

My approach to this was to iterate through both lists given while also inserting them into a new linked list. I made new next nodes when there was need of one. There is a lot of redundant code but I couldn't think of a better way to do this problem.
