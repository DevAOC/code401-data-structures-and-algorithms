# Linked List

In this code challenge we are tasked with making a linked list and nodes for that linked list. We should be able to use methods on the linked list so we can traverse, insert a node at the front of the list, and turn the list into a string. There were no criteria about not using built in methods.

## Whiteboard Process

I did not include a Miro board for this code challenge. I used some of the code from class to complete my assignment. The recursive traversal method was my code from the class period and so I used it again here but could not find out a good way to use recursion for the other methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

I used iteration for all of my methods and wrote small amounts of code to suplement the needs of each method.
